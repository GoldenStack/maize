# Maize

Maize is a specialized programming language, designed for writing descriptive, relevant, and consistent code. 

It aims to provide minimal resistance in converting ideas to code, while also being internally consistent and, as a whole, making sense as a language.

## TODO
- Read expressions repeatedly until EOF (to finish reading a line after a root left-associative operator)
- Add parentheses to the AST to handle operator precedence correctly
- Implement significant whitespace (stolen from Haskell and Python)
